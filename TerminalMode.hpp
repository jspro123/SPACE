		"We've checked and double-checked and triple-checked that the ship's trajectory is right; "
		"if we're off by even one degree we'll probably never wake up.";

	std::string s_log1_3 = "Still pissed that they picked me. I told them I'm married, no one fucking cared. "
		"I told them I won't go, they tried to arrest me. Fuck that. How does a guy tell his family "
		"that he'll be gone for six years straight?";

	std::string s_log1_4 = "Commander's telling me it's time to go. . . Mary, I'm so sorry.";

	std::string s_log2_3 = "We've landed on the important piece of shit that they sent us to. Nothing here, "
		"just empty space and craters everywhere. Apparently the valuable stuff is somewhere under all this "

		"We start tomorrow. Can't wait. ";

	/* ================== LOG TEXT 3 ================== */

	std::string s_log3_3 = "I can't wait to leave, to be honest. It's been a rough week. I've been "
		"having nightmares non-stop since coming here. Commander says it's a rare side effect of the cryo, "
		"but I don't remember hearing anything like that back on Earth. And it's not just me, either; looks "
		"like everyone has the same problem. ";

	std::string s_log3_4 = "Whatever. The faster we finish, the sooner we leave. ";

	/* ================== LOG TEXT 4 ================== */

	std::string s_log4_2 = "Major breakthrough: it turns out that we do have a magic rock sensor. I found it "
		"today near the digging equipment. Somehow, we all forgot about it. Very strange. Another side "

	/* ================== LOG TEXT 5 ================== */

	std::string s_log5_2 = "We've finally found it. A sample of the rock-thing that the scientists said would "
		"be here. Looks almost like a ruby - very pretty. Soon as we found it, the commander grabbed it "
		"and threw it in the toolbox near the cryo room. No idea why. Said we're done here and to start "
		"preparations for departure. Told us to dump all the digging equipment out. To lighten the load "
		"for the return trip. ";

	std::string s_log5_3 = "We came all the way here for one rock? The hell? Commander says these orders "
		"come from the top. Need-to-know basis. I'm too much of a fucking peasant in the pecking order "
		"to know, he says. Well, he didn't say that bit. But it's implied. ";

	std::string s_log5_4 = "We leave within three days. Finally.";

	/* ================== LOG TEXT 6 ================== */

	std::string s_log6_2 = "Nightmares are getting worse. Way worse. Ever since we brought the rock in. "
		"Just me this time, though. Doesn't help I sleep in the cryo-room alone. ";

	std::string s_log6_3 = "In my dreams, I hear a voice, telling me to do things. Horrible things. "
		"I don't understand what's going on. ";

	/* ================== LOG TEXT 7 ================== */

	std::string s_log7_2 = "I changed my pod's wake-up time. Sometime in two years. I don't know why. "
